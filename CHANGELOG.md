## DEV/MASTER


**Resolved issues:**

- Fixed issue for Finland as Midsummer's Day (st. Johns Day) was always calculated to be on June 24th. However since 
  1955, the holiday has always been on a Saturday (between June 20 and June 26).

**Implemented enhancements:**

**Resolved issues:**

- The Vernal Equinox Day and Autumnal Equinox Day in Japan were excluded from having it substituted for another day in

  false failures in the unit tests.
