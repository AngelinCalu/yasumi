     * the Julian calendar. As a date in the Gregorian calendar of Christendom, New Year's Day liturgically marked the

     * In present day, with most countries now using the Gregorian calendar as their de facto calendar, New Year's Day
     * is probably the most celebrated public holiday, often observed with fireworks at the stroke of midnight as the
     * new year starts in each time zone.
